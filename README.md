# Database-Project-topUmd

Why we chose this topic:
Our goal of the project is to help potential students select the best business graduate school to attend, based on a variety of factors. In addition, we would like to improve the ranking of the Smith School and help it to be considered as a high-ranked business school in the future as well. Thus, we design a conceptual model of the agencies which rank Business Graduate Programs in the United States using the entity-relationship model.

How our team worked together:
Our team met once weekly to discuss each week’s upcoming deliverables. We discussed ideas for initial proposal, mission statement, mission objectives, database design, and visualization display. Meanwhile, we kept confirming our direction with the Professor and corrected our content with his comment. Eventually, we presented our slides and expressed our findings and recommendations to the class.

Data Sources:
For Business Schools: we looked at each school’s website, which usually has most of the demographic information that we needed. Each school has the most reporting on MBA class profiles, so we mostly used this information for comparison purposes.  
Stanford University: https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/mba/admission/class-profile   
University of Pennsylvania (Wharton School): https://mba.wharton.upenn.edu/class-profile/   
Northwestern University (Kellogg School of Management): https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/class-profile.aspx  
University of Chicago (Booth School of Business): https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/full-time/admissions/class-profile  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Sloan School of Management): https://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/admissions/class-2023-profile  
Harvard University: https://www.hbs.edu/mba/admissions/class-profile/Pages/default.aspx  
University of California, Berkeley (Haas School of Business): https://mba.haas.berkeley.edu/admissions/class-profile  
Columbia University: https://academics.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/admissions/class-profile  
Yale University: https://som.yale.edu/programs/mba/admissions/class-profile  
University of Maryland: https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/news/quick-look-full-time-mba-class-profile  

For the information that we could not find on each graduate business school’s website directly, and for additional information, we used a combination of the following websites:  
https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/university-of-maryland-college-park-01104  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wharton_School_alumni  
https://www.topmba.com/mba-programs/mba-programs-highest-graduate-salaries  
https://mba.haas.berkeley.edu/careers/employment-report  
https://www.univstats.com/comparison/master-of-business-administration-mba/graduation-rate/  

For Faculty & Publication: we chose two symbolized faculties for each business school, each faculty with distinguished characteristics like director of a department or nobel prize winner. Then, for each faculty, we picked the most cited publication sorted in Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en&as_sdt=20000007). So there would be two faculties for each business school and one publication for each faculty.

For Donation:
We collected the donation information from the website of each business school or from business news agencies like Bloomberg. For most schools, we listed donations of multiple years, up to recent 10 years. But for some schools, such as Stanford, Columbia, Yale, and University of Maryland, we could find only 1 calendar year’s donation. In addition, for MIT, we listed it as null because its website did not show specific donations for business school.

For Rating Agency:  
To compare, we chose one main ranking agency for our main ranking standard, which we chose the US News. And for the other two ranking agencies, we chose Bloomberg and QS. As for the school list, we chose the top 9 schools based on the US News ranking, as well as the University of Maryland Smith School. Therefore, we had the top 9 ranked schools and our university to be our experimental object.

Creating DDL and DML:  
To establish the database in SQL, firstly we should create tables including primary keys and foreign keys for each entity and the necessary relationships (relationships with many to many cardinality). To avoid missing foreign keys during inserting values, we created tables with the order of strong entities, corresponding relationships, and then weak entities.  
So, we implemented following steps using BUDT703_Project_0507_03:  
1. Implemented corresponding DROP TABLE statements for tables we will create. 
2. Implemented CREATE TABLE statements and INSERT INTO statements with the corresponding data and definitions we compiled previously. 

Next, we converted our mission objections as eight WH-style-questions, then we implemented SQL SELECT statements to answer each business transaction question:  
1. What faculty has taught for the highest number of years, which business school and what is their school’s USNews ranking?  
2. What is the faculty and their number of publications, in order of publication amount, for the faculty that have Nobel prizes, and what is their corresponding business school?  
3. What is the relationship between the USNews ranking and the financial support in terms of donations to the school, in order of donations?  
4. What is the comparison between the USNews Ranking and the average of the agency rankings, in order of USNews Ranking for each business school?  
5. What 5 faculty had the highest number of awards, and what is their corresponding business school’s USNews ranking?  
6. What is the relationship between the proportion of female students and the USNews ranking?  
7. What is the relationship between the proportion of the international students and the USNews ranking?  
8. What is the relationship between employment rate, salary, and USNews Ranking, in order of employment rate and highest salary?  
  
Applications:  
Our data will be helpful to students that are considering which graduate business school to attend, as well as graduate business schools that would like to improve their rankings. For the students, they can compare various factors across schools, and see which schools align better with their career ambitions. Our database and case applications are helpful to schools, because they can see where they stand not only with overall rankings, but also with individual factors. They can see comparisons between things like faculty years of experience and rankings, or proportions of female students and rankings, and potentially target a few of these individual factors at a time to hopefully boost overall rankings. Our model introduces insights into new relationships between various factors and school rankings that each school may have never before considered.  

Future Work:  
Our model could be expanded to include more graduate business schools. With more data, we would be more likely to extract trends that we cannot see with a limited dataset. In addition, another version of our model could be adapted for various other types of schools, though some of the attributes may be different depending on the relevant factors for different types of schools. For example, a Residency attribute would be relevant if we adapted our model to medical schools.
